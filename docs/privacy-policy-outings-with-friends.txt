Outings with Friends (“the App”) is provided by Cavez AI Innovations. 
If you have any questions about this policy, you can contact us at:

2. What the app does
Outings with Friends helps you plan activities with friends, track itineraries, manage shared expenses, and chat about your plans.

3. Data we collect

3.1 Account information
- When you create an account, we may collect your email address, name, and profile picture.
- This is used to create your profile, let you sign in, and show your name and avatar to your contacts and group members.

3.2 Outing and content data
- When you create outings, we store details like title, date/time, location, itinerary items, images, Piggy Bank contributions, and expenses.
- This information is used only to provide the core features of the app (planning, sharing, and tracking events with others you choose).

3.3 Location data
- Location is used when you choose to select or share a place on the map.
- We do not track your location in the background.
- Location is only used while you interact with map/location features.

3.4 Photos and media
- When you add an image to an outing, we request access to your camera or photo library.
- We only access the photos you choose to upload. These images are stored on our servers to show them inside the app to you and the participants of that outing.

3.5 Usage and technical data
- We may collect basic technical information such as device type, operating system, and error logs.
- This is used to improve performance, fix bugs, and keep the app reliable.

4. Notifications
- With your permission, we send push notifications about new messages, invites, and activity related to your outings.
- You can turn notifications off at any time in your device settings.

5. How we share data
We do not sell your data.
We may share limited data in these cases:
- With other participants in an outing (for example, your name, profile picture, messages, and the outing details you choose to share).
- With service providers that help us run the app (for example, hosting, storage, and notification services), under appropriate data protection agreements.
- When required by law, to comply with a legal request or protect our rights.

6. Data retention
- We keep your account data for as long as you have an account.
- You may request deletion of your account, after which we will delete or anonymise your personal data within a reasonable timeframe, except where we must keep some information for legal or security reasons.

7. Security
We take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect your data, such as using secure connections (HTTPS) and access controls on our servers.  
However, no online service can be 100% secure.

8. Children’s privacy
Outings with Friends is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

9. Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
If we make significant changes, we will notify you in the app or by other appropriate means. The updated policy will be effective when posted.
