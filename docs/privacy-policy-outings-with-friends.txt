Privacy Policy – Outings with Friends

Last updated: 19 December 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Outings with Friends (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses and protects your information when you use our mobile application and related services (collectively, the “App”).

By creating an account or using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy.

1. Information we collect

We collect the following types of information:

1.1 Account information

When you create an account, we may collect:

Name or display name

Email address

Password (stored using industry-standard hashing)

Profile photo (optional)

1.2 Outing & content data

To provide the core functionality of the App, we store information you choose to add, such as:

Outing titles, descriptions, dates and times

Locations and map coordinates for outings and itinerary items

Itinerary notes and schedule details

Uploaded images for an outing

Piggy Bank targets and contribution amounts

Expense entries, including amount, description and category

Lists of participants and invitations (e.g., email addresses or phone numbers you choose to invite)

1.3 Usage & device information

When you use the App, we may automatically collect:

Log data (e.g., API requests, error logs, timestamps)

Device type, operating system version, and app version

General usage information (e.g., which screens are opened, basic interaction flows)

We do not collect your phone’s contact list automatically. When you manually type an email or phone number to invite someone, that contact information is only used to send or record the invitation.

1.4 Location information

With your permission, the App may access your approximate or precise location in order to:

Help you set an outing location

Show location-related features within the App (e.g., maps)

You can control location access at any time in your device settings. If you disable location, some features may not work fully, but you can still use the App by entering locations manually.

1.5 Push notification tokens

If you opt in to notifications, we collect a device notification token (e.g., via Firebase Cloud Messaging) so we can send you:

Updates about your outings

Invites and relevant reminders

Important service messages

You can turn notifications off at any time in your device settings.

2. How we use your information

We use the information we collect to:

Create and manage your account

Let you create, view and manage outings, itineraries, images, Piggy Bank and expenses

Show you the outings you organize or are invited to

Send invitations and updates to participants you choose to invite

Provide push notifications and in-app messages

Improve stability and performance (debugging, monitoring errors)

Protect against abuse, fraud or misuse of the service

Comply with legal obligations where applicable

We do not sell your personal data.

3. Legal bases (for users in the EEA/UK)

If you are located in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we process your personal data on the following legal bases:

Contract: to provide you with the App and its features, at your request

Legitimate interests: to improve the App, keep it secure, and understand how it is used, where these interests are not overridden by your rights

Consent: for optional features such as push notifications or access to location, where required

You can withdraw your consent at any time via your device settings (for permissions) or notification settings.

4. How we share your information

We may share your information in these situations:

4.1 With other users

Some information you choose to add will be visible to other participants or viewers of an outing, depending on its visibility settings:

Outing title, date, time and location

Itinerary items and notes

Piggy Bank and expense summaries for that outing

Your name / profile photo where shown as organizer or participant

The visibility settings for an outing (Public, Contacts, Groups, Invited) determine who can see it.

4.2 Service providers and infrastructure

We may share data with third-party providers who help us operate the App, such as:

Hosting and database providers

Push notification services (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging)

Map and location providers (e.g., Mapbox)

Email or SMS providers used for invitations or account messages

These providers are allowed to use your data only to perform services on our behalf, and must handle it securely.

4.3 Legal requirements

We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests, or when we believe it is necessary to:

Protect our rights or property

Protect the safety of users or the public

Detect or prevent fraud, security or technical issues

We do not share your information with third parties for their own advertising purposes.

5. Data storage & international transfers

Our servers and some of our service providers may be located in countries other than where you live. This means your information may be processed in a country that may have different data protection laws than your own.

We take reasonable steps to ensure that your information is protected in accordance with this Policy wherever it is processed.

6. Data retention

We keep your information for as long as:

Your account is active, or

It is necessary to provide you with the App and its features, or

We have a legitimate business need or legal obligation to retain it.

If you delete your account, we will remove or anonymize your personal data within a reasonable period, subject to any legal requirements to keep certain records (for example, basic log records or security backups).

Outing content (itineraries, expenses, Piggy Bank, messages) will generally be deleted or anonymized as part of account deletion, or when the outing is removed by its organizer.

7. Your rights and choices

Depending on your location, you may have rights over your personal data, including:

Access – request a copy of the information we hold about you

Correction – ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete data

Deletion – request that we delete your personal data, where applicable

Restriction – request that we limit the processing of your data in certain cases

Objection – object to certain processing, such as for direct marketing

Data portability – receive your data in a commonly used, machine-readable format, where technically feasible

You can also:

Update your profile information in the App

Adjust notification permissions in your device settings

Turn off location access from your device settings

To exercise any of your rights, please contact us using the details in the Contact us section below. We may ask you to verify your identity before responding.

If you are in the EEA/UK, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

8. Children’s privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13 years of age (or the minimum age required by your local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age.

If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.

9. Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information, including:

Using secure connections (HTTPS) where appropriate

Hashing passwords instead of storing them in plain text

Limiting access to personal data to people who need it to operate the service

However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

10. Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will change the “Last updated” date at the top.

If changes are significant, we may provide additional notice in the App or by email where appropriate. Your continued use of the App after changes take effect means you accept the updated Policy.
